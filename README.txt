# What's This?

mp3dirscrape is a quick script for watching a directory for files to magically arrive. When they do, it checks if the `id3v2` utility (which you will have to have installed) can figure out if it's a music file.  If it is, mp3dirscrape assumes it's an MP3 format file and copies it in a nicely named way to another directory you supply.  It doesn't delete the original.  It assumes that files only get added to the directory to be watched when they are complete (not still being written).
